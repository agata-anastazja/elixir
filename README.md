## Backend Engineer - Technical Test

The following test is used to give us an idea of your technical style and ability. It should take somewhere in the region of 2-3 hours, so whilst we would prefer you complete it using Elixir and Phoenix, you may use any language and framework which will allow you to complete the exercise roughly within the timeframe.

### The exercise

The exercise requires you to build a simple web application which fulfils the following criteria:

* **Ingests a few simple CSV files** - Use the URL [here](https://data.police.uk/data/fetch/a9482988-d36b-44d3-b0db-bd1aa20be410/) to download a ZIP file, containing some subfolders and CSV files. These files represent reports of crimes obtained on the open Police Data website; they are limited to the first 6 months of this year and the Essex police force to keep the dataset to a reasonable size. You should import these CSV files into a database of your choice, and store them however you wish.
* **Shows the data on a page** - Create a simple page in your framework of choice that we can visit to view the data in a reasonable manner. Do not worry about fancy styling or layouts - this is not what we are trying to assess.
* **Allow simple sorting or filtering** - Create a way to sort or filter the data by one of the fields. What you choose to search or sort on is up to you; all we would like to see is your approach.
* **Shows an understanding of unit/integration testing (OPTIONAL)** - If you have time or are familiar with TDD (test-driven development), show us an example of how you would choose to test your implementation.

Do not worry about:

* Styling or layout (unless you have time or wish to take that upon yourself)
* Pagination

### Submission

To submit your solution, please either:

* Put the code under source control, publicly host the repository on Github, and provide us a link, or
* Send us a ZIP file including everything we would need to run it ourselves.

Once we receive your submission, we will try to re-run it locally, and take a look at your code style. We'll then get back to your shortly to give you our feedback.

Good luck!
